# Apophysis 7X

### A new Pythonic Beginning
I'm embarking on a fun (and perhaps foolish) rewrite of the Apophysis codebase into modern python.

==============OLD STUFF================

Apophysis was written with Delphi 5.0 and is now developed using Delphi XE2

The rendering engine (with some modifications) comes from a screensaver by Ronald Hordijk: http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~rhordijk/progs.html#flame
The original flame code was written by Scott Draves: http://flam3.com/index.cgi?&menu=code

## Third party libraries
To compile you'll need a few third-party controls and libraries:

### Scripter Studio

### XML Parser

### Indy Internet Components

### Portable Network Graphics Delphi
